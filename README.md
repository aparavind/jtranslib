# Indian Languages transliteration tool

Hi this is a transliteration tool for indian languages.
For example consider a single text

> niyatam kuru karmatvam.

 (do your duty allotted)

The above is fine however English is not enough to represent the same.
so does niyatam spell as niyatam with t as in `thing` or t as in `tomato`. to clarify it is generally written in baraha English

> niyataM kuru karmatvam.

Easy to write but harder to read.

This tool written in pure JS is a simple tool which is used to transliterate the same into a regional indian language of choice. for eg. in devanagiri it would be.

> नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वम्

## Explanation

Jindtrans uses the following opensource componants

 1. Jquery
 2. tinymce

 A writer can give any formmatting in the tinyMCE window and he is required to write in baraha English as required.
The Reader will however read in the language of his choice. In the preview.
